                <p>It may sound a bit cliche but put shortly, I'm looking to be the best version of myself possible. Whether it's my projects, personal goals, or personal fitness, I want to be at the top of my game. Unfortunatley, like most things in life, that is easier said than done! Thats why I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, learn and push myself out of my comfort zone! When it came to physical fitness, my motto was "I will never stop!" â€”and now, I'm expanding that mindset to encompass all areas of my life!</p>
